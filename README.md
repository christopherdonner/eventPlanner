# eventPlanner

### 12/03/2019:

Event Planner
A web server with registered API endpoints, pushing dynamically built html from handlebar templates with SQL data.

We have built an event planner app with UIs for event planners and another for event attendees.

### Technology used:
##### javascript
##### jQuery
##### Node.js
##### MySQL
##### sequelize
##### handlebars
##### moment.js
##### fullcalendar
##### bootstrap

### Our product is built around our database consisting of 3 tables:
## Users
## Events
## Notifications

The Planners complete a form to create the event, this is sent via ajax in a `POST` to the api/events endpoint. Existing events will have edit and delete buttons.
Edit on click will do a `PUT` to `api/events`, triggering a sequelize update call to the database.
They can then navigate to the current events page at /events/ where a `GET` to `api/events` will

New users complete a form, on click, the form data is sent in a `POST` request to api/users, inserting a new row in to the users table.
We pull a list of existing users with a GET request to api/users.
Clicking on an existing user will route to `/userss/:id`
The users are able to see a list of all existing events with a `GET` to our `api/events`
If a user clicks on an event, a modal is shown with the event details and "Interested!" and "No Thanks!" buttons. If the user clicks "Interested!", a `POST` is made to api/notifications triggering an insert into notifications where the current user is the sender and the owner of the event is the recipient with a default text of `${user.name} is interested in attending ${event.name}!`
The user will be added to the JSON object in event.attendees
The users page displays a calendar to be populated with the events the current user exists in attendees for.

For your viewing pleasure, our original design notes are below:
